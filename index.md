description: A Java Library for Quantum Computing and Quantum Information Science
---

A project based in **_Quantum Computing_** and **_Quantum Information Science_**. This project was built using [**_Java_**](https://www.java.com/) and [**_JUnit_**](https://junit.org/). The [**_QuISL (Quantum Information Science Library)_**](https://quisl-framework.github.io/) is a [**_Java_**](https://www.java.com/) **_Library (or Toolbox/Framework)_**, _which will act as_ **_Simulator_** _of this new technology_, as also, _will allow to build and study_ **_Quantum Circuits_**, **_Quantum Algorithms_**, among many others, using a **_Object-Oriented Language_**, such as [**_Java_**](https://www.java.com/) **_Programming Language_**.

> The history of the Universe is, in effect, a huge and ongoing Quantum Computation. The Universe is a Quantum Computer.

This theme is designed for writing documentation websites instead of having large unmaintainable README files or several markdown files inside of a folder in a repository.

## Installation
{:.mt-lg-0}

This theme is designed to work both as a Gem or as a remote theme, meaning we officially support GitHub Pages.

### Gem

Add this line to your Jekyll site's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "jekyll-docs-theme"
```

And then enable and use the theme in your Jekyll site via its `_config.yml`.

```yaml
theme: jekyll-docs-theme
```

### GitHub Pages

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
remote_theme: allejo/jekyll-docs-theme@v{{ site.project.version }}
```

## Features
{:.mt-lg-0}

Several features are approached in this [**_Java_**](https://www.java.com/) **_Library_** for **_Quantum Computing_** and **_Quantum Information Science_**, such as:

* #### Quantum Operations/Logic Gates

    * All the **_Quantum Operations/Logic Gates_** necessary for the building of custom **_Quantum Circuits_** and **_Quantum Algorithms_**, are available.

* #### Quantum Fundamental Principles

    * The well known **_Quantum Fundamental Principles_**, such as, **_Quantum Superposition of States_**, **_Quantum Entanglement of States_**, **_Quantum Measurement of States_**, **_Quantum Parallelism_**, **_Existence of Quantum Multiverse_**, among many others, are available.

* #### Quantum Demonstrations

    * Some practical examples, such as, **_Schr√∂dinger's Cat_**, **_Quantum Coin Toss_**, **_Bell State_**, **_GHZ State_**, **_Quantum Teleportation_**, **_Superdense Coding_**, among many others, are available, through simple demonstrations.

* #### Quantum Algorithms

    * ##### Quantum Mapping

    * ##### Quantum Optimisation

    * ##### Quantum Factorisation

    * ##### Quantum Cryptography
