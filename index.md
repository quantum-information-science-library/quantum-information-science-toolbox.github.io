description: A Java Library for Quantum Computing and Quantum Information Science
---

A project based in **_Quantum Computing_** and **_Quantum Information Science_**. This project was built using [**_Java_**](https://www.java.com/) and [**_JUnit_**](https://junit.org/). The [**_QuISL (Quantum Information Science Library)_**](https://quisl-framework.github.io/) is a [**_Java_**](https://www.java.com/) **_Library (or Toolbox/Framework)_**, _which will act as_ **_Simulator_** _of this new technology_, as also, _will allow to build and study_ **_Quantum Circuits_**, **_Quantum Algorithms_**, among many others, using a **_Object-Oriented Language_**, such as [**_Java_**](https://www.java.com/) **_Programming Language_**.

> The history of the Universe is, in effect, a huge and ongoing Quantum Computation. The Universe is a Quantum Computer.

This theme is designed for writing documentation websites instead of having large unmaintainable README files or several markdown files inside of a folder in a repository.

## Installation
{:.mt-lg-0}

This theme is designed to work both as a Gem or as a remote theme, meaning we officially support GitHub Pages.

### Gem

Add this line to your Jekyll site's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "jekyll-docs-theme"
```

And then enable and use the theme in your Jekyll site via its `_config.yml`.

```yaml
theme: jekyll-docs-theme
```

### GitHub Pages

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
remote_theme: allejo/jekyll-docs-theme@v{{ site.project.version }}
```

## Features
{:.mt-lg-0}

Despite being a mediocre theme, we've got a features that we're especially proud of and dedicate a lot of our time to making sure they work as expected.

### Graceful Degradation

This theme uses as little JavaScript as possible. All of our anchors and table of contents are generated at build time. Any features that rely on JavaScript have fallbacks for graceful degradation. It's how the web should be nowadays.

### Heavily Customizable

A lot of parts in these theme consist of empty Jekyll includes that are designed to be overridden by website owners. Inject your custom code easily to any part of the website!

### Dark Mode

We all know that dark mode makes you a better human. This theme supports a dark mode based on each user's preference.
