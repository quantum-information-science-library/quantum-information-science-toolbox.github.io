description: A Java Library for Quantum Computing and Quantum Information Science
---

A project based in **_Quantum Computing_** and **_Quantum Information Science_**. This project was built using [**_Java_**](https://www.java.com/) and [**_JUnit_**](https://junit.org/). The [**_QuISL (Quantum Information Science Library)_**](https://quisl-framework.github.io/) is a [**_Java_**](https://www.java.com/) **_Library (or Toolbox/Framework)_**, _which will act as_ **_Simulator_** _of this new technology_, as also, _will allow to build and study_ **_Quantum Circuits_**, **_Quantum Algorithms_**, among many others, using a **_Object-Oriented Language_**, such as [**_Java_**](https://www.java.com/) **_Programming Language_**.

> "The history of the Universe is, in effect, a huge and ongoing Quantum Computation. The Universe is a Quantum Computer."

> ~ _Seth Lloyd_

This project is aimed to provide to the user a full experience in **_Quantum Computing_** and **_Quantum Information Science_**, as also, all the features related to it.

## Features
{:.mt-lg-0}

Several features are approached in this [**_Java_**](https://www.java.com/) **_Library_** for **_Quantum Computing_** and **_Quantum Information Science_**, such as:

* #### Quantum Operations/Logic Gates

    * All the **_Quantum Operations/Logic Gates_** necessary for the building of custom **_Quantum Circuits_** and **_Quantum Algorithms_**, are available.

* #### Quantum Fundamental Principles

    * The well known **_Quantum Fundamental Principles_**, such as, **_Quantum Superposition of States_**, **_Quantum Entanglement of States_**, **_Quantum Measurement of States_**, **_Quantum Parallelism_**, **_Existence of Quantum Multiverse_**, among many others, are available.

* #### Quantum Demonstrations

    * Some practical examples, such as, **_Schr√∂dinger's Cat_**, **_Quantum Coin Toss_**, **_Bell State_**, **_GHZ State_**, **_Quantum Teleportation_**, **_Superdense Coding_**, among many others, are available, through simple demonstrations.

* #### Quantum Algorithms

    * Some **_Quantum Algorithms_**, are also available, such as, the following ones, among many others:

        * ##### Quantum Mapping

        * ##### Quantum Optimisation

        * ##### Quantum Factorisation

        * ##### Quantum Cryptography
        
* #### Quantum Applications

    * Some **_Quantum Applications_**, are also approached, through some practical examples and demonstrations, such as:

        * ##### Quantum Image Processing
        
        * ##### Quantum Networks/Communications
        
        * ##### Quantum Game Theory
